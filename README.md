* This project is built in Java using Spring Data REST framework with Mongo DB at backend.

* It only consists of the server side code that publishes REST web services that can be consumed by different client modules.

* All build configurations are done using Gradle build tool and internal code is configured using Spring Boot that enables quick and easy setup.

* It also utilizes Spring Boot’s MongoRepository JPA to make connections to database.

* For Mongo’s database space, I have used mlab’s free space that allows a max storage of 500MB.
